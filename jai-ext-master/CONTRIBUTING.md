# Contributing

The structure and rules for the JAI-Ext project are intentionally simple at this stage given the small team involved.

For more information, on how to work with the project I would recommend to read the GeoServer Guide to Contributing [here](http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/docguide/contributing.html).

The only evident difference is that at this stage we do not have set up yet a Contributor License Agreement for working on the project, although we plan to provide something soon.
