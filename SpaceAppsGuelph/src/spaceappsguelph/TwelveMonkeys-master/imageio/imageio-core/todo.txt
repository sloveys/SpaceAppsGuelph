- Rename to imageio-common?
- Add stream support for NIO and NIO2 stuff? Path, ByteChannel
- Faster RAF support (need to buffer the slow readShort/readInt/readLong/readUnsignedShort/readUnsignedInt)
- See if it's possible to use FileImageInputStream for FileChannels and FileInputStream to avoid the caching
- And the above for output streams too...
DONE:
- Split up into separate plugins (modules), to allow easier configuration
