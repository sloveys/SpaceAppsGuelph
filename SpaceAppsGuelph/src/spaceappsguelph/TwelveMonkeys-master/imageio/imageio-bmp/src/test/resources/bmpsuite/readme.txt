BMP sample files are taken from BMP Suite Version 2.3 by Jason Summers
(http://entropymine.com/jason/bmpsuite/).

From the readme.txt:

"Image files generated by this program are not covered by this license, and are
in the public domain.

Files in the "g" directory I consider to be "good":
Your program should definitely support them if it claims to support BMP.

Files in the "q" directory I consider to be "questionable":
These may be really unusual, or technically violate the documentation in some
way, or I may be unsure about their validity.

Files in the "b" directory I consider to be "bad":
These are clearly invalid or unreasonable. Make sure your program doesn't crash
when reading them."
